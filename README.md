## Introduction

Blackjack, also known as Twenty-One, is a comparing card game between a player and a dealer. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by getting a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

## Rules

1. The player is initially dealt two cards and the dealer is dealt one card face up.
2. The player can choose to "hit" to receive another card or "stand" to stop receiving cards.
3. The player's cards are totaled, with face cards counting as 10 and aces as 1 or 11 (player's choice).
4. If the player's total exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.
5. If the player stands, the dealer reveals their facedown card.
6. The dealer must hit if their total is 16 or less and must stand if their total is 17 or more.
7. If the dealer's total exceeds 21, they bust and the player wins the game.
8. If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the one with the higher total wins.
9. If both have the same total, it's a tie, called a "push."
